# USA300GWASPUB
Results, data, model and code for the paper 'Interpreting roles of mutations associated with the emergence of S. aureus USA300 strains using transcriptional regulatory network reconstruction'

The contents are divided into 4 main folder:

* **data**: contains all the interim and processed data from the paper. Large data such as genome sequences, fastq files are not included.

* **figures**: figures in the paper. Note: the final figures in the paper may have been altered for clarity and aesthetics.

* **notebooks**: jupyter notebooks containing all code used to run the analysis and generate most of the figures.

* **tables**: subset of the data that are specifically mentioned in the paper or are provided for convenience.

Ouput of DBGWAS was also further analyzed using code in the [DBGWAS Network Analysis repo](https://github.com/SBRG/dbgwas-network).
